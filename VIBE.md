# Escape Orbit - Input Tracking

This file tracks all input prompts used during the development of the Escape Orbit game.

## Initial Project Setup

```
Initializing a Git repository for a web-based game called "Escape Orbit". The game must be accessible on the web without login/signup, and work on mobile browsers (e.g., iPhone) with no loading screens or heavy downloads.

### Project Overview
"Escape Orbit" is a 2D game where the player controls a spaceship orbiting Earth. The goal is to escape orbits by burning fuel at the right moment to reach and colonize the next planet, avoiding hazards like meteors and black holes. Fuel management is key: orbiting drains fuel slowly, escaping costs fuel, and colonizing planets refuels slightly. The game progresses through planets in a solar system and beyond, with a high-score system.

### Technologies
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the game in the browser.
- **JavaScript**: Core language for game logic and interactions.
- **PixiJS**: Lightweight 2D rendering engine for sprites, graphics, and animations.
- **NippleJS**: Virtual joystick library for mobile controls.
- **Howler.js**: Audio library for sound effects.
- **LocalStorage**: For saving high scores locally.
- **GitHub**: Hosting the code.

### Task
Initialize a Git repository with the basic structure and files needed to start development. Include:
1. A project folder structure with necessary files.
2. An `index.html` file with a canvas element and script links to the technologies (use CDNs for simplicity).
3. A `main.js` file with initial PixiJS setup (create an application, stage, and a test circle for Earth).
4. A `README.md` file with a brief project description and setup instructions.
5. A `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., node_modules).
6. A `VIBE.md` where you keep track of all my imput prompt. 

### Instructions
- Use CDNs for PixiJS, NippleJS, and Howler.js to avoid npm dependencies and ensure instant loading.
- Keep the setup lightweight and minimal to meet the "no loading screens" requirement.
- Comment the code to explain key sections for future development.
- Create a conda enviroment called escape-orbit and activate it
- Initialize the repo as if it's ready for GitHub Pages deployment (e.g., all files in the root).
