# Escape Orbit - Development Progress

## Summary of Current Status

The Escape Orbit game is a 2D space exploration game where players control a spaceship to navigate a solar system, orbit planets, and colonize them. Here's what has been implemented and modified so far:

### Core Mechanics

1. **Solar System Setup**
   - Sun with gravitational influence and danger zones
   - Multiple planets with different sizes, colors, and orbital paths
   - Increased planet orbit spacing to prevent overlap

2. **Spaceship Controls**
   - Movement with thrust and directional control
   - Orbiting mechanics allowing the spaceship to enter orbit around planets
   - Trajectory prediction showing the expected path when exiting orbit
   - Custom orbit radius that matches the player's distance when entering orbit
   - Boost mechanics with variable power based on planet size

3. **Gravitational System**
   - Planets and sun have gravitational fields affecting the spaceship
   - Adjusted gravitational field opacity for better visual clarity
   - Grace period for reduced gravity after exiting orbit

4. **UI Elements**
   - Orbit indicators that show the current orbit path
   - Help text displaying instructions when in orbit
   - Planet labeling and visual feedback for visited/colonized planets

### Recent Enhancements

1. **Visual Improvements**
   - Reduced opacity of gravitational fields to avoid visual clutter
   - Increased orbit radii around the sun to create more space between planets
   - Added visual indicators for potential orbit paths

2. **Gameplay Enhancements**
   - Implemented variable boost power when exiting orbit, with stronger boosts for smaller planets
   - Added customizable orbit radius that matches the player's position when entering orbit
   - Set minimum and maximum orbit distances for better gameplay balance
   - Increased boost multipliers for more dramatic planet exits

3. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed issues with orbit transitions
   - Adjusted trajectory prediction to match actual exit speeds

## Next Steps

1. **UI and Player Experience Improvements**
   - Add more emojis throughout the game UI for better visual cues
   - Add detailed instructions at the beginning of the game
   - Reduce text size on mobile devices for better UI scaling
   - Remove boost button and controller on mobile for a simplified experience
   - Create a randomly generated solar system after completing the current one

2. **Hazards and Obstacles**
   - Implement black holes that spawn randomly but not directly in planets' orbital paths
   - Add meteor showers with variable intensity
   - Create asteroid fields that player must navigate through

3. **Core Gameplay**
   - Add game states (start screen, level transition, game over, etc.)
   - Implement a proper scoring system with high scores
   - Design multiple levels with increasing difficulty

4. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Add particle effects for boost and planet colonization
   - Improve the spaceship visual design with different states (boosting, burning, etc.)
   - Add background stars and parallax effects

5. **Audio**
   - Implement sound effects for all game actions (boosting, entering orbit, etc.)
   - Add background music

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize rendering for better performance on mobile devices
   - Implement object pooling for particles and other frequently created objects

7. **Additional Features**
   - Add different spaceship types with unique properties
   - Implement upgrades that can be collected or purchased
   - Add more celestial objects (moons, asteroids, etc.)

## Technical Considerations

1. **Code Organization**
   - The game is structured into separate classes for different game objects
   - Main game logic is in `game.js` with specialized objects in the `objects/` directory

2. **Game Balance**
   - Further tuning of physics parameters may be needed for optimal gameplay feel
   - Adjusting fuel consumption rates and refill amounts for better game balance

3. **Cross-Platform Testing**
   - The game needs thorough testing on different devices and browsers
   - Touch controls may need further refinement for mobile devices
